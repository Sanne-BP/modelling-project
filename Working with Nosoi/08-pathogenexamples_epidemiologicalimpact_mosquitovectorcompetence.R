##############Pathogen example: epidemiological impact of mosquito vector competence variation######
rm(list = ls())

#--------------Introduction
#Vector competence (VC) defines the intrinsic ability of a vector to carry and transmit a pathogen. VC is usually scored experimentally as the prevalence of infected and infectious vectors at given times post-pathogen exposure. Each year, numerous experimental studies aim to evaluate VC for various arthropod species or populations for vector-borne pathogens, which ultimately aims to understand epidemiology and assess local risk of transmission for potentially introduced vector-borne pathogens. These experimental data however usually remain purely descriptive and poorly reflect the dynamic nature of VC. nosoi can be used to easily translate such empirically observed within-host dynamics into their impact on an epidemic process through simulations, without the use of advanced mathematics. The epidemic process can be tailored to mimic known parameters of a particular place of interest, or can be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù to allow easy comparison of one or several key variables.

#This example aims to illustrate how to use nosoi to perform such a study. We will use data derived from the following published article: (Fontaine et al., (2018))

#In this paper, Fontaine et al. explore the impact of variation of within-host dynamics of dengue virus 1 in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on a simulated epidemic process. They compare, in the same population of Aedes aegypti from Thailand, the dynamics of 8 viral isolates. In the example here, we will compare three of these isolates, called Laos2012, Haiti2012 and Thai2010b using epidemic processes simulated using nosoi. Most of the parameters of this set of simulations will be derived from the Fontaine et al. paper, specifically supplementary table 1.


#--------------Setting up the simulation framework
#We will restrict ourselves to a relatively simple simulation, as the idea is to compare three viral isolates under the same set of parameters except for the ones linked to vector competence in the mosquito. Time steps will be in days. This simulation obviously puts us in the case of a dual-host pathogen, but we will not use any spatial or population structure (for more details on this type of simulation, see the relevant tutorial). Hence, only 3 core functions of nosoi need to be parameterized for each host:
    #the daily probability to exit the simulation (pExit), either being cured of the disease for a     human or dying for a mosquito.
    #the daily number of infectious contacts with different potential hosts (nContact), which would     be the number of times per day a human is bitten by a susceptible mosquito, or the number of       times per day a mosquito is biting a different human.
    #the probability to transmit the virus once an infectious contact occurs (pTrans). This will be     dependent on the within-host dynamics in each host, and will be the place where vector             competence will influence the epidemic process.


#----Host A: Humans
#pExit
#In Fontaine et al., humans do not die from the dengue infection, but exit the simulation when their transmission probability approaches 0 on its way down (see below). To approximate this behavior, we will use one of the parameters used in pTrans, called Md_human, which is the time since infection at which pTrans equals 50% of its maximum value. We will assume here that after three times this period, an infected human cannot transmit the virus any more and will thus exit the simulation:
p_Exit_fct_human <- function(t,Md_human){
  if(t < 3*Md_human){p=0}
  if(t >= 3*Md_human){p=1}
  return(p)
}

#nContact
#This parameter was not determined in Fontaine et al., as unlike in nosoi, each mosquito in the simulation was simulated. Since the daily probability of a mosquito to bite is 0.3 and the relative density of mosquitoes compared to humans equaled 3, we can estimate that the daily probability to get bitten by a mosquito is approximately 0.9. Of course, this should correspond to a distribution of integer numbers (such as 0, 1, 2). We will therefore make draws from a Poisson distribution with rate parameter ùúÜ= 0.9.
n_contact_fct_human <- function(t){rpois(1,0.9)}

#Fontaine et al. model the transmission probability of a human to a mosquito using a 5-parameter equation based on two logistic functions, allowing the value of pTrans to go up in time, reach a plateau and then decrease over time:
p_Trans_fct_human <- function(t, K_human, Mg_human, Bg_human, Md_human, Bd_human) {
  K_human*1/2*((1+tanh((t-Mg_human)/Bg_human))-(1+tanh((t-Md_human)/Bd_human)))
}

#Dynamics of viremia in vertebrate (see EIP paper for justification)

K_human_fct <- function(x){rbeta(x,0.98,0.002)}

Mg_human_fct <- function(x){rnorm(x,4.844,0.5)}
Bg_human_fct <- function(x){rnorm(x,2.536,0.2)}

Md_human_fct <- function(x){rnorm(x,8.392,0.5)}
Bd_human_fct <- function(x){rnorm(x,4.038,0.2)}

param.pTrans_human <- list(K_human=K_human_fct, Mg_human=Mg_human_fct, Bg_human=Bg_human_fct, Md_human=Md_human_fct, Bd_human=Bd_human_fct) 

#Probably useful for plotting population dynamics, but then ofcourse more peaks and downs


#----Host B: Mosquitoes
#pExit
#In Fontaine et al., the daily survival probability of a mosquito is 0.85, 
#so its pExit equals 1-0.85:
p_Exit_fct_mosquito <- function(t){return(0.15)}

#nContact
#In Fontaine et al., the daily biting probability of a mosquito is 0.3. We assume that if a mosquito bites, it bites only one human:
nContact_fct_mosquito <- function(t){sample(c(0,1),1,prob=c(0.7,0.3))}

#pTrans
#In Fontaine et al., the probability of transmission from a mosquito to a human is approximated by the measure of dissemination, a proxy for the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). We will assume here that pTrans is defined in the form of a threshold function: before a certain amount of time since initial infection (EIP), the mosquito does not transmit (t_EIP), and after that time, it will transmit with a certain (constant) probability (which we will call p_max). This function will be dependent on the time since the mosquito‚Äôs infection t:

#pTrans will of course vary according to the viral isolate studied. EIP was measured dynamically for each mosquito population over time as the proportion of mosquitoes with disseminated viral infections. This experimental measure, a mean of the whole population, is modeled as a logistic function characterized by three parameters:
  #ùêæùëöùëúùë†ùëûùë¢ùëñùë°ùëú (K_mosquito), the maximum probability of transmission.
  #ùëÄùëöùëúùë†ùëûùë¢ùëñùë°ùëú (M_mosquito), the time when 50% ùêæùëöùëúùë†ùëûùë¢ùëñùë°ùëú is reached during the                                         ascending phase.
  #ùêµùëöùëúùë†ùëûùë¢ùëñùë°ùëú(B_mosquito), the slope of the ascending curve.

#According to our initial hypothesis, these population curves are actually formed by a heterogeneous population of mosquitoes ‚Äúswitching‚Äù from infected to infectious, thus t_EIP is individually set and can be extracted from the logistic curve of the population, representing the probability distribution, and p_max is actually 1 for most of the mosquitoes, but can be 0 (some will never transmit despite being infected) for a few others:

#values will be drawn from a logistic distribution with location M and scale 1/B (see above)

p_max_fct_Laos <- function(x){rbinom(x,1, 1)}
t_EIP_Laos <- function(x){rlogis(x, location = 4.9, scale = 1/2.37)}
    #Laos isolate has the shortest t_EIP, so they become infectious faster
    #In Laos, all mosquitoes eventually transmit

p_max_fct_Haiti <- function(x){rbinom(x,1, 0.94)}
t_EIP_Haiti <- function(x){rlogis(x, location = 7.36, scale = 1/0.92)}
    #Haiti isolate has the longest t_EIP, so they take longer to become infectious
    #In Haiti, 6% of mosquitoes never transmit the virus

#-------------------------------Running Nosoi
#Since all core functions have been set, we can now proceed with the simulation. We will set a maximum total length of 400 units of time as in Fontaine et al., with a maximum of 10,000 infected humans and 1,000,000 infected mosquitoes (to be sure the total number of mosquitoes will not be a limiting factor). The epidemic will start with one infected human. The nosoi script will then look like:

#The simulation has run for 154 units of time and a total of 10169 (A) and 21261 (B) hosts have been infected.






#-----------------------------Analyzing the Results and Conclusions
#To analyze the results, we classify each simulation into 3 categories based on the number of humans infected: over 100 infected, below 100 infected and no secondary cases (i.e. just one infected). We then plot the results as follows:

#As we can see, the isolate Haiti2012 yielded less ‚Äúbig outbreaks‚Äù (> 100 humans infected) compared to the two other isolates, which is coherent with its slower within-host dynamics (i.e. variations in vector competence, defined as the intrinsic ability of a vector to carry and transmit a pathogen). This result is similar to the one obtained in the original paper which used an earlier version of nosoi in a closed population.

#With a set of simulated transmission chains and associated metadata anchoring them in time, and sometimes space, nosoi offers a perfect setting to explore how within-host dynamics can drastically influence a pathogen‚Äôs epidemiology. Changes in any of the parameters are easy to implement, including drastic changes on how a certain probability or number is computed, allowing for maximum flexibility.
