#Next step is to let the population dynamics start at t = 0, as the nosoi simulation also starts from t = 0, right now my population dynamics start at t = 1!
#After that, try to model it with more extreme parameters to actually see if it works. For now I have been keeping everything very small and realistic, this way changes cannot even be seen.
